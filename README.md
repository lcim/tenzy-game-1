## About Tenzies Game: It's a continuation of the project started at Scrimba in "Learn React" series. I took the skeleton and transformed it into a nice game.
# tenzy-game-1
A game of two players using 10 dice. It involves flipping all the dice to one face value, eg threes, or sixes. After five sets, the player with most set wins is declared winner. NOTES:

Game of two named players from user input;
Involves players rolling 10 dice to make sure all dice have same face Value; eg all have face 4 or 6 etc. This condition is called a tenzie.
When a die face is selected, the face value remains unchanged as one rolls the dice to get matching face values
Number of attempts by each player is recorded;
Each player must achieve 5 tenzies; meaning the game involves playing 5 rounds/sets.
The number of attempts made before achieving tenzy is stored in each player's history.
After each round, the attempts are compared and a winner for that round declared; the overall winner is decided based on the number of sets won, not based on overall number of attempts.
The least number of attempts in achieving a tenzy is stored and updated in localStorage as a newRecored. Happy gaming experience!
